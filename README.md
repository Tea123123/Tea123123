**Modeling Project Interactions in Multiattribute Portfolio Decision Analysis: Axiomatic Foundations and Practical Implications**
- The objective of this project is to create a portfolio utility model that can account for the interactions between projects.
- The program file contains Python code that performs the following tasks:
  - Generates simulations for multi-attribute projects with randomly generated values
  - Uses Gurobi to solve for the optimal project portfolio under resource constraints
  - Produces charts that illustrate the experimental results, which will be included in an academic manuscript.

**Poor choices and post-decision surprises â€“ the impact of evaluation uncertainties in multiattribute decision-making**
- The aim of this project is to investigate how the properties of a multiattribute utility model affect post-decision surprise and decision quality. 
- The accompanying program file includes Python code to:
  - Generate simulations for a one-out-of-many multiattribute selection problem.
  - Create a utility function that can be adjusted by a single parameter to modify the risk attitude (concavity/convexity).
  - Compute metrics to evaluate decisions, such as post-decision surprise, differences in expected utility, and probability of selecting the truly optimal choice.
  - Produce charts that visually depict the experimental results, which will be included in an academic manuscript.

**Portfolio decision analysis approach for selecting a portfolio of interdependent actions in the regional climate roadmap in Finland**
- The goal of this project is to assist in the decision-making process for selecting an optimal portfolio of environmental initiatives that address the challenges of climate change. Specifically, we develop a model and process that incorporate expert opinions on the interactions between actions.
- The program file includes Python code for the following tasks:
  - Importing survey data and transforming it to be integrated into the model.
  - Selecting the optimal portfolio of initiatives while accounting for resource constraints, taking into account the overall magnitude of interactions between actions.
  - Generating charts that depict the composition of the optimal portfolio, which will be included in an academic manuscript.

# **Small-scale Data Science Project**

**Money laundering detection using Logistic Regression and XGBoost**
- The objective of this project is to create a robust model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions related to money laundering.
- Within this Jupyter notebook, you will find code for:
  - Importing and transforming transaction data for machine learning purposes
  - Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to identify key independent variables
  - Training two machine learning models for predicting fraudulent transactions: XGBoost and Logistic Regression
  - Evaluating model performance using FNR, FPR, AUC curve, and DET curve for thorough analysis.
