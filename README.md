**Modeling Project Interactions in Multiattribute Portfolio Decision Analysis: Axiomatic Foundations and Practical Implications**
- In this project, we develop portfolio utility model that can incorporate interaction effects between projects. 
- The program file includes Python code of
  - Simulating Multiattribute projects using randomly generated values
  - Solving optimal portfolio of projects under resource constraints using Gurobi
  - Drawing charts to depict the experimental results to be included in academic manuscript
